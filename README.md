1. Identify Key Dependencies
For your Flask-based deployment, you need the following essentials:

Flask: For the web application framework.
Pillow: For image processing (used in Tkinter previously).
opencv-python: For face recognition or other OpenCV-related tasks.
numpy: For numerical computations.
tensorflow (if used for machine learning).
mysql-connector-python (if you are using MySQL for the database).
pandas: If working with dataframes for attendance records.
